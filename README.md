How to Play
Starting the Game: Press any key to begin the game.
The game will start with a simple sequence of button blinks from the four different buttons.
After the sequence plays, you must repeat it by clicking the corresponding buttons in the correct order.
If you successfully repeat the sequence, the game will add another button to the sequence.
If you make a mistake, the game will end, and you'll have the option to play again.
